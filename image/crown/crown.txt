MAKE YOUR STEINWAY GRAND a crown jewel
The STEINWAY CROWN JEWEL COLLECTION is
 an exclusive series of rare, fine veneers available 
in all STEINWAY grand models.

Each STEINWAY CROWN JEWEL is an original handcrafted work of art, 
unique in all the world. CROWN JEWEL pianos are encased 
in your choice of magnificent woods, prized for their exquisite color 
and grain, and gathered from around the world. STEINWAY & SONS 
craftspeople meticulously match the grain from one end of the piano 
to the other â€” even across the beveled edge of the lid. Individually 
distinguished with a special LIMITED EDITION medallion indicating 
its uniqueness, a CROWN JEWEL is a STEINWAY that truly makes 
itself heard even before you touch the keys.
