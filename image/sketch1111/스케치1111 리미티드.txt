With THE TEAGUE SKETCH 1111, STEINWAY is delighted to marry 
Henry STEINWAY’S timeless aesthetic and legacy of innovation 
to that of the peerless Walter Dorwin Teague.    


American industrial designer, architect, illustrator, 
man of letters and entrepreneur Walter Dorwin Teague
 (1883–1960), a classicist and traditionalist, was a critical 
figure in the spread of mid-century modernism in America.

FORM and function
Simple and sophisticated, THE TEAGUE SKETCH 1111 comes
 in a dark-walnut veneer or a satin ebony finish, with a simplified case, 
tapered legs, tailored arms, and subtle brass ferrule accents. Available
 as a model M (the STEINWAY “studio grand”), THE TEAGUE SKETCH 
1111 is a natural fit in mid-century styled homes and in contemporary 
styled décors.
THE TEAGUE SKETCH 1111 is also a STEINWAY & SONS SPIRIO,
 the world’s finest high resolution player piano. A masterpiece of 
mid-century modernism and modern engineering in your home, 
SPIRIO enables you to enjoy performances captured by great pianists 
— played with such nuance, power and passion that it is utterly 
indistinguishable from a live performance.
