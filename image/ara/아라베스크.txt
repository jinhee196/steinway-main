 THE ARABESQUE
The Arabesque was created with renowned furniture
 designer Dakota Jackson in honor of STEINWAY’s 160th anniversary. 
The stunning ARABESQUE is a Limited Edition with a unique
 and innovative design approach.

ON THE ARABESQUE
“The Arabesque Piano combines the grace of the classical dancer 
and the intertwining motif witnessed in Moorish design — sound 
in movement. The physical presence of the Arabesque was a direct 
link to what I initially composed in my thoughts. It was a thought 
dream coming alive.”
— Dakota Jackson

Kin to the intimate, lyrical creation by Robert Schumann, also titled 
“Arabesque,” or recalling Debussy's pensive masterpiece of the same
 name, the 160th Anniversary Limited Edition Arabesque 
by Dakota Jackson touches the soul with a pure beauty. 
The instrument captivates with exquisite design accents, 
giving an impression of fluidity and movement. In ballet, 
an "arabesque” is a pose held suspended in time, with the limbs 
of the dancer impossibly extended. It conveys a sense of channeled
 energy, flowing freely through the tips of the fingers and toes,
 outward and upward into the ether.


“Steinway is synonymous with Piano. I wouldn't consider designing
 a piano for any other company.”
